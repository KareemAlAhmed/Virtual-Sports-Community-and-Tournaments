## About The Project

This project focuses on creating a virtual sports community and organizing online tournaments to engage sports enthusiasts in Lebanon. The mobile application and website serve as a platform for users to connect with fellow sports enthusiasts, join virtual leagues, and participate in friendly competitions. Google Cloud Vision can be leveraged to analyze sports-related images or videos uploaded by users, allowing them to share their achievements and moments of sportsmanship. The platform can also integrate Google ML API to provide live match predictions, analyze game statistics, and offer insights into player performance. The admin interface enables organizers to create and manage tournaments, moderate user-generated content, and ensure fair play and sportsmanship.
